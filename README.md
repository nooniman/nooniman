## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Anas Mohammad E. Demonteverde
but that's too long so call me Nas.

I'm currently taking up Information Technology at Western Mindanao State University.

I'm 21 (as of 2024) and I just now found out about GitHub after studying IT for 3 years now.
Such disappointment, very bad.
Anyways, hello again world!
